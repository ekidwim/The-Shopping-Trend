# The-Shopping-Trend

# Overview

**Context**

The Customer Shopping Preferences Dataset provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and buying patterns. Businesses need to comprehend customer preferences and trends to customize their products, refine marketing strategies, and improve the overall customer experience. This dataset encompasses a diverse array of customer attributes, including age, gender, purchase history, preferred payment methods, purchase frequency, and more. Analyzing this data facilitates informed decision-making for businesses, enabling them to optimize their product offerings and elevate customer satisfaction. The dataset serves as a crucial asset for businesses seeking to align their strategies with customer needs and preferences. It is important to emphasize that this dataset is a Synthetic Dataset designed for beginners aiming to enhance their understanding of Data Analysis and Machine Learning.


**Content**

This dataset encompasses various features related to customer shopping preferences, gathering essential information for businesses seeking to enhance their understanding of their customer base. The features include customer age, gender, purchase amount, preferred payment methods, frequency of purchases, and feedback ratings. Additionally, data on the type of items purchased, shopping frequency, preferred shopping seasons, and interactions with promotional offers is included. With a collection of 3900 records, this dataset serves as a foundation for businesses looking to apply data-driven insights for better decision-making and customer-centric strategies.

# Project Highlight

**Data Preprocessing**: The dataset used for the analysis consists of 3900 rows and 18 columns, with no missing or duplicate values. The dataset features include various attributes related to customer purchases such as Customer ID, Age, Gender, Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount (USD), and more.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The EDA section includes outlier detection and analysis of various features. For instance, it was observed that individuals categorized as 'elderly' (those aged over 50) spend more than adults, although the difference is not significant.

**Unsupervised Machine Learning**: The project uses K-means clustering to analyze purchasing behavior by category and customer clustering by age and purchase amount (USD). The results show that purchasing behavior is balanced between those below and above 60 years of age, and spending is consistent across all age groups.

**Conclusion**: The analysis concludes that individuals under 60 years old typically do not purchase expensive items exceeding 60 USD, but those aged 60 and above tend to buy expensive items. However, their purchasing behavior remains consistent, as they continue to buy across all categories.

**Business Recommendations**: The project suggests selling all categories of products as there will always be customers interested in buying, and developing a one-stop-shop experience for customers with a wide range of products at various price points.
